### Hi there, I'm Robert 👋

🔭 I am currently a senior front-end developer, weightlifter, and building a site for a Crossfit gym in Santiago, Chile.
🌱 I’m currently learning Go, advanced algos, and event-driven architecture.
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on building side-businesses.
💬 Ask me about weightlifting, nutrition, and/or frontend development.
